            <h4>classification & distribution</h4>
            <p>
                The Utahraptor lived during the Early Cretaceous period, specifically around 135 to 130 million years
                ago. It inhabited current day United States, specifically in the region of Utah. This is known because
                Fossils of Utahraptor have been found in the Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah. The Cedar Mountain
                Formation is known for its diverse ecosystem and paleo-findings which included dinosaurs such as
                ankylosaurs and iguanodonts species. It's important to understand that the distribution of Utahraptor
                during its time was limited to the areas where its fossils have been discovered. Since Utahraptor's
                fossil record is incomplete, it is reasonable to believe that there may have been other regions where it
                lived but have not yet been discovered or studied.
            </p>
            <h4>behaviors & adaptations</h4>
            <p>
                The Utahraptor probably died out because of its ever-so changing environment; the Earth cooling down and
                Utahraptors incapable of adapting to such changes. This might've been the main reason why Utahraptors
                everywhere ceased to exist after a time. They went to exist for around 5 million years before going
                extinct. Utahraptors were a warm-blooded large, feathered, actively predatory theropod. Utahraptor packs
                may have probably lived in forests or deserts/prairies where hunting wouldn't be a problem. (It's
                important to note, it is a big if when it comes to being cold or warm blooded, we simply don't have
                enough information to confirm.)
            </p>
            <h4>special features & identification</h4>
            <p>
                It was quite easy to identify a Utahraptor. Its body's significantly large than the famous velociraptor.
                They were sleek, feathered, bipedal, with a heavily built, ground dwelling body. The Utahraptor has a
                narrow, sharply defined snout and forward looking eyes. They may have had also small, serrated teeth
                that lined its jaws, which were used to dispatch its prey. The massive raptor also had a large "killing
                claw" on its second toe, which it used to capture and kill its prey.

                <h4>who discovered the infamous killer?</h4>
                <p>This is an easy answer, Jim Jensen in 1975. However, his initial findings were too fragmented to
                    identify
                    the dinosaur accurately. It wasn't until 1991 where the Utahraptor was fully uncovered by James
                    Kirkland, Robert Gaston, and Donald Burge during a dig sponsored by the Prehistoric Museum. All of
                    the
                    discoveries were in Utah, hence the name Utah-raptor. Even until today, we are still making great
                    findings in this dinosaur’s ancient history. Games like Jurassic World: The Game and Path of Titans
                    include this great dinosaur for players to find. It can be a fun and interactive way to see how this
                    dinosaur may have been size-compared.</p>

                <h4>predators & prey</h4>
                <p> It is truly a debate, whether or not the Utahraptor hunted in packs, as it was so large and fierce
                    by
                    itself. There are many sources and research scientists where they believe Utahraptors did hunt in
                    packs.
                    It was although, believed strongly that they followed a typical Dino-family system depicted in
                    movies,
                    such as defending eggs or bringing back food to the nest. The Utahraptor was its most dominant
                    carnivore
                    in its ecosystem, eating pretty much any dinosaur it desired. Scientists believe that the diet of
                    Utahraptor also included Iguanodonts, a large herbivore.</p>

                <h4>what fossil history are we talking about?</h4>
                <p>James Kirkland, the state of Utah's paleontologist, uncovered and named the Utahraptor in 1993. The
                    fierce creature also became the official state dinosaur in 2018. He believes that Utahraptors at the
                    site of Stikes Quarry got stuck in sinking pits of quicksand when they tried attacking plant-eating
                    dinosaurs that were already trapped there. Their death and submersion actually were a long-term
                    preservation of their body.</p>

                <p>Very recently, Kirkland and a small team had removed a giant 18,000 pound block of Utahraptor fossils
                    from Stikes Quarry. His new study includes an edit of the dinosaur's age, being 135 million years
                    old,
                    around 10 million more than previously theorized.</p>

                <h4>about breeding and life cycle</h4>
                <p>In fact, Utahraptors likely did not live a special life cycle compared to other dinosaurs. As many
                    other
                    dinosaurs, a Utahraptor probably started off in an egg and went through an incubation process. Its
                    lifespan is unclear, however, many sources will say 70-80 years, whilst others may say a bit over
                    20. As
                    expected, there are not any known special breeding behaviors. However, a recent find in that mega
                    block
                    as stated earlier includes the remains of six Utahraptor. It was the remains of a 16-foot long
                    adult,
                    four youngsters, and a possible baby 1-foot long Utahraptor. And as we may know, the mega block’s
                    reason
                    to why the bodies were so perfectly preserved in a time span of millions of years were because it
                    was,
                    meaning it could just be a coincidence. Kirkland believes otherwise, and that it was definitely a
                    Utahraptor family. This is especially important because this could be the beginning of understanding
                    Utahraptor behavior in an unexpected way.</p>

                <h4>size range & ways our dinosaur communicated</h4>
                <p>The Utahraptor was a pretty large dinosaur, weighing over half a ton to a bit over a ton, being 6
                    feet in
                    height and up to 23 feet in length, Being significantly larger than the famous velociraptor, it was
                    also
                    probably the smartest dinosaur of all time. Dromaeosaurs, in fact, were one of the most intelligent
                    group of dinosaurs ever to exist. This is because paleontologists figure out relative dinosaur
                    intelligence based on the animal's Encephalization Quotient, or EQ. The EQ of troodontids is about 6
                    and
                    dromaesaurs aren't far behind with an EQ of 5.8. For a more relative comparison, humans have the
                    highest
                    EQ of 7.4-7.8. </p>

                <h4>other utahraptor species & relative habitatual behaviors</h4>
                <p>What’s so interesting about our amazing creature is that we have only ever discovered this dinosaur
                    to be
                    of one species. That species being Utahraptor ostrommaysorum meaning “Utah’s predator”. The
                    Utahraptor
                    took its habit in the plains of North America. Specifically floodplains and open woodlands with
                    riverine
                    forests. The Utahraptor probably wasn't very fast, so it likely used cover to lie and wait for prey.
                    Utahraptor packs also likely lived in forests or deserts/prairies where hunting wouldn't be
                    problematic.
                    It is approximated that they also had a certain amount of territory, around 3 miles all around.
                    Their
                    territory would have been near a water source which could suggest Utahraptor ate fish as well.</p>
